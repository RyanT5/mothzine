Want some rich and gooey brownies that require minimal effort and taste delicious? If you’re anything like the Mothzine flat then you are constantly in need of baked goods to function during lockdown. Here is a vegan brownie recipe that you will probably have everything you need for in your kitchen cupboards! I basically made up this recipe from a few different ones and perfected it after a few tries so the measurements aren’t exact, so feel free to get creative!

## Ingredients: 
- 2 cups plain flour 
- 1 cup sugar 
- 1 cup cocoa powder 
- 1 teaspoon baking powder 
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 
- 1 cup water 
- 1 cup vegetable oil (any oil you have can be used really) 
- A little bit of instant coffee 
- Peanut butter, chocolate or nutella to drizzle on top

## Method: 
Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.  
Put all of your dry ingredients into a bowl and mix well! Make sure the flour is all nice and combined. Then add your water and vegetable oil, and stir until nice and smooth. If it needs a drop more water then add.  
Then, take a cup and put a half spoon of instant coffee in the bottom, and sir with roughly a tablespoon more water. Then, add this little coffee mixture to your bowl. This will add a really delicious richness to the brownies! Add your vanilla extract now and stir a bit more, making sure everything is combined.  
Now, pour your brownie mixture into a baking tray either greased or lined with tin foil. At this point I usually take some peanut butter and Nutella and drizzle it on top, but this is totally optional. You can even melt some chocolate for the top. 
Put your brownies in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until a fork comes out clean. This really depends how gooey you like your brownies.  

Now try not to eat them all at once :)
